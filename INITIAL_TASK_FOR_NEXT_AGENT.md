# Initial Task for Next Agent

## Status (session 2026-11-01 — maintenance re-verification, COMPLETE)
- Prior agent task read from HANDOFF.md + INITIAL_TASK_FOR_NEXT_AGENT.md; re-derived evidence rather than trusting prior claims.
- `git status`: clean (branch main, up to date with origin/main, HEAD b351643).
- Full suite: `PYTHONPATH=/home/runner/work/NQ-ORB/NQ-ORB/src python3 -m pytest tests -q` -> 71 passed.
- SHA-256 hashes verified unchanged and match HANDOFF.md exactly (all six files):

- Walk-forward: artifacts/walk_forward_axb0306.json (3 windows all negative), artifacts/walk_forward_kaggle.json (8 windows all negative).
- Free-data re-sweep: GitHub axb0306/cme-futures-ohlc MNQ path latest commit still 60abd3fb… 2026-04-15T23:34:55Z (unchanged); no new genuinely free MNQ 1min/15min source found beyond axb0306 (~3 months, single-contract MNQ.M26, unadjusted) and Kaggle front-month (~3 years, unadjusted front-month by max volume); Yahoo daily only. No data purchased; no credentials requested/stored.
- Frozen baseline preserved; no code/strategy/parameter changes; no broker integration; working tree clean.

## Bounded next task
1. Maintain documentation; if a new free MNQ 1min/15min source appears, record provenance/hashes (source, URL, retrieval date, symbol/contract, timezone, roll/adjustment method, SHA-256) before use.
2. No parameter/strategy changes without a separately named, versioned experiment with an explicit diff from the frozen baseline (STRATEGY_RULES.txt v1.0).
3. If longer free history is obtained, re-run chronological splits and cost sensitivity across full periods; preserve a final untouched out-of-sample interval.
4. Keep HANDOFF.md and INITIAL_TASK_FOR_NEXT_AGENT.md updated with evidence.
5. Research task remains blocked on data depth, not code — highest-value action is a bounded free-data re-sweep if anything changes; otherwise continue maintenance only.

## Test command
- `PYTHONPATH=/home/runner/work/NQ-ORB/NQ-ORB/src python3 -m pytest tests -q` (71 passed)

## Blockers
- History depth insufficient for robust walk-forward/OOS: axb0306 ~3 months (single-contract MNQ.M26, unadjusted); Kaggle front-month ~3 years (unadjusted front-month by max volume). No multi-year free MNQ 1min/15min beyond these.
- Results negative under full costs on both available samples (costs dominate).
- axb0306 roll/adjustment method: single-contract, no roll in sample; verify hash/continuity if re-downloaded.

## Hard boundaries (AGENTS.md)
- Historical research and simulation only. No broker integration/order routing/live trading/paper trading/deployment.
- Never request/add/print/persist broker/API credentials.
- Do not purchase data or use paid/proprietary services; prefer freely accessible datasets; never bypass access controls/terms.
- Do not launch nested Kilo sessions/duplicate scheduled workflows/additional GitHub Actions activations.
- Do not edit `.github/workflows/main.yml`, controller helper code, permissions, or automation policy without explicit authorization.
- Do not delete research evidence, overwrite raw data, or reset/rewrite Git history to conceal failure.
